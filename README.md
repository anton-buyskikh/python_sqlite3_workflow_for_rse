## Disclamer

Provided here solutions are overly simplified and not always the best way of doing things. This is done merely for instructive purposes and introduction to the workflow and SQL syntax. For instance, refer to [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for futher steps towards more professional solutions.
